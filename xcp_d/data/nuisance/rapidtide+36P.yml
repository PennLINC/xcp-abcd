description: |
	In total, 37 nuisance regressors were selected from the preprocessing confounds,
	according to the '36P+rapidtide' strategy.
	These nuisance regressors included
	six motion parameters, mean global signal, mean white matter signal,
	mean cerebrospinal fluid signal with their temporal derivatives,
	and quadratic expansion of six motion parameters, tissue signals and
	their temporal derivatives [@benchmarkp;@satterthwaite_2013].
	In addition to the 36 regressors described above, the time-lagged global signal
	from rapidtide was included as a voxel-wise nuisance regressor.
