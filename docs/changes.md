**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/PennLINC/xcp_d/compare/0.3.0...0.3.1


## 0.3.0

We are happy to announce a new minor release, with several backwards-incompatible changes.

Two big breaking changes are (1) there is a new `--dcan-qc` flag that determines if the executive summary and DCAN-format QC files will be generated, and (2) custom confounds should now have headers, should be tab-delimited, and should have the same names as the fMRIPrep confounds, for easier indexing.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/PennLINC/xcp_d/compare/0.2.0...0.2.1


## 0.2.0

This is a big release. There are a lot of backwards-incompatible changes, as well as a number of bug-fixes and enhancements.

There is a full list of the changes made between 0.1.3 and 0.2.0 below. However, here are some highlights:

1. We have renamed and reorganized a number of the outputs created by `xcp_d` to better follow BIDS convention. There is a lot in `xcp_d` that falls outside the current BIDS specification, so we took inspiration from a number of BIDS Extension Proposals (BEPs) that folks have written over the years.
2. There is a new `--warp-surfaces-native2std` flag, which produces a number of subject-specific surfaces in fsLR space. This was previously run by default in version 0.1.3. The workflow that this flag triggers is also much improved, thanks to @madisoth.
3. We have fixed a major bug, in which the parameter set users selected was ignored, and "36P" was used no matter what.
4. The HTML reports have been improved. The interactive segmentation image from the executive summary has been added to the main report, along with the BOLD-T1w coregistration figure. We have also added a new plot to show the impact of filtering motion parameters on censoring.
